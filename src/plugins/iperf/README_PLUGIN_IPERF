Iperf plugin
===========

Provides a fake protocol that can be customized by the caller via query
arguments.
It can be used for testing.
Supported arguments:

- list
    For directories, a comma separated list of items as
    name:mode(octal):size(decimal)
- size
    File size, in bytes
- size_pre
    File size, in bytes, for stats previous to a copy
- size_post
    File size, in bytes, for stats following a copy
- checksum
    Checksum value
- time
    Time that a copy will take. To be specified on the destination URL.
- errno
    Trigger an error with this errno number
- transfer_errno
    Trigger an error with this errno number *during the transfer*
- staging_time
    Staging total time
- staging_errno
    Fail the staging with this error number
- release_errno
    Fail the release with this error number
- signal
    Raise the signal specified as an integer

Also, if the string IPERF_LOAD_TIME_SIGNAL is found on any parameter for the current process (obtained reading
/proc/self/cmdline), the following digits will be used to raise a signal at instantiation time.

By default, signals are disabled. They have to be enabled setting SIGNALS to 1.

Examples
--------

Fail with a ENOENT
    gfal-stat iperf://host/path?errno=2

Stat a regular file with a size of 1000 bytes
    gfal-stat iperf://host/path?size=1000

Trigger a copy that will take 5 seconds
    gfal-copy "iperf://host/path?size=1000" "iperf://host/path2?errno=2&size_pre=0&size_post=1000&time=5"

Trigger a segfault
    gfal-ls "iperf://host/path?signal=11"
